# InvestSupport
An idea was to create a pet project for iOS which will help you with your investment-related deals. 

In a purpose to create this application I had to learn a lot of new technologies starting with Cocoa Pods and ending ending with Core Data and Unit tests.
As pods I used Alamofire and SwiftyJSON. Moreover, to implement charts in my app I decided to use StockCharts(https://github.com/denniscm190/stock-charts) and ILineChart by ISwiftUI(https://iswiftui.com).

Data are getting with an url request from Yahoo's servers and saved in Core Data. Furthermore, I chose SwiftUI to built up views.
